      "short_summary": "Center-left candidate Yamandu Orsi has won Uruguay's presidential runoff election with 49.8% of the votes against conservative Alvaro Delgado's 45.9%. The former history teacher and two-time mayor's victory marks the return of the left-wing Broad Front coalition to power after five years of conservative rule. Outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou promptly conceded defeat and offered to begin the transition process.",

        "Electoral Margin: The difference of 92,000 votes in a country of 3.5 million people showed a clear but close victory.",
        "Political Shift: This election represents a return to power for the left-wing Broad Front coalition after a five-year conservative interlude.",
        "Campaign Style: The election was notably free of anti-establishment rhetoric, contrasting with recent populist trends in neighboring countries.",
