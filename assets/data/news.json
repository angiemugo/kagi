        "short_summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring Republican Senate leadership candidates to allow recess appointments, which would enable him to bypass traditional Senate confirmation votes for cabinet positions and other key officials. Trump argues this is necessary to prevent lengthy confirmation processes that he claims took up to two years during his first term. This move comes as Senate Republicans prepare to select their new leader following their narrow majority win in the chamber.",
